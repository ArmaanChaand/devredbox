# Marquee Animation — React & HTML/CSS 

A smooth infinite horizontal scrolling animation designed for React with Tailwind CSS and plain HTML/CSS. This marquee component lets you create seamless scrolling effects for logos, testimonials, or any repeating content.

Multiple customizable versions of this infinite scrolling marquee are available down below, from pure CSS implementations to JavaScript-enhanced options.

Each version of this marquee animation has its own trade-offs as described in each section below.

## Simple Horizontal Marquee — No JavaScript

This infinite horizontal scrolling animation is built with pure CSS or Tailwind CSS utility classes. No JavaScript is used, making it lightweight and performant.

```tsx
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"
import {
  RadioGroup,
  RadioGroupItem,
} from "@/components/ui/radio-group"

```

Not using JavaScript comes with the limitation that — 
- On bigger screens there may be blank spaces for a few seconds if the marquee component doesn't have absolute width
- No advanced features can be added like speed control or pause on hover, unlike the JavaScript-enhanced versions available below
